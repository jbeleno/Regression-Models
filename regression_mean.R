# Regression to the mean (Luck)
#
# Why is it that the children of tall parents tend to be tall, but not as tall as their parents?
# Why do children of short parents tend to be short, but not as short as their parents?
# Why do parents of very short children, tend to be short, but not a short as their child? And the same with parents of very tall children?
# Why do the best performing athletes this year tend to do a little worse the following?
